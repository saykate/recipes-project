    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Sourdough Bialys get a distinct flavor and texture from active your
      sourdough starter.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Bialy is not just a bagel without the hole in the middle. They are not
      boiled, so the crust is crisper than a typical bagel. The topping can be
      anything under the sun, though the traditional topping is onion and poppy
      seed.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup (8 oz, 224g) active sourdough starter</li>
      <li>1 1/4 cups (10 oz, 300 ml) warm water</li>
      <li>3 1/2 cups (17.5 oz, 490g) bread flour</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons table salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <h4>For the Dough</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine the starter with the water and 2 cups of the flour in the bowl
        of a stand mixer or a large mixing bowl. Mix to form a thick batter.
        Cover the bowl and set aside for 30-60 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the sugar and salt. Switch to the dough hook. Add the remaining
        flour and mix to combine. The dough should eventually cling to the hook
        and start to clear the sides of the bowl. If the dough is still a little
        sticky sprinkle in a little more flour, just a tablespoon at a time.
      </li>
      <li>
        Knead 5 minutes on medium speed. If working by hand, stir in as much of
        the flour as you can, then turn the dough out onto a lightly floured
        surface and knead in the remaining flour. Knead 5 minutes. Form the
        dough into a smooth ball.
      </li>
      <li>
        Put the dough into a lightly oiled bowl, turning once to coat the dough.
        Cover the bowl and set it aside at room temperature.
      </li>
      <li>
        After 30 minutes uncover the bowl, lift one side of the dough and fold
        it into the middle of the dough. Repeat with the other three sides of
        the dough then flip the dough over. You're basically turning the dough
        inside-out to redistribute the yeast. Cover the bowl and after 30
        minutes repeat the procedure. Cover the bowl and after 60 minutes repeat
        the procedure again. Cover the bowl and after 60 minutes the dough
        should be ready to shape (total fermentation time is about 3 hours. By
        now the dough should be lively, elastic and airy. If the dough is still
        sluggish give it another hour or two at room temperature.
      </li>
      <li>Meanwhile, make the filling.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>For the Filling</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Melt the butter in a sauté pan. Add the minced onion and salt and sauté
        until the onions are soft and translucent, but not browned.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from the heat and add the poppy seeds. Add salt and pepper to
        taste. Set aside to cool. Refrigerate until ready to use.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Shape the Bialys</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Generously flour a parchment-lined baking sheet. Turn the dough out onto
        a lightly floured surface without kneading. Divide the dough into 10
        equal portions. Roll each portion to a ball.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pick up a piece of dough. Pinch the dough and gently pull to form a 4"
        disc. Set each bialy onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving 2" between
        for room to rise. Cover the pan with plastic wrap and place the pan in
        the refrigerator overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the morning, take the pan out of the refrigerator. Generously
        sprinkle two baking sheets with corn meal.
      </li>
      <li>
        Working carefully not to deflate the dough, pick up a bialy and gently
        re-stretch to about 4" around. Use your fingers to form a depression in
        the middle of each bialy. Set each bialy onto the prepared baking sheet,
        leaving 2" between them. Place 5 bialys onto each pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the pan loosely with plastic wrap and set aside to rise for about
        1 hour. The bialys will not double in size, but they should be
        noticeably lighter and increase about 50%. Meanwhile, preheat the oven
        to 450°F.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spoon a teaspoon of filling into the middle of each bialy and gently
        push to reform the dimple in the middle. Bake until lightly browned,
        about 20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Serve slightly warm or room temperature.</li>

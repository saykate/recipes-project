        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          This pound cake has the tang of a citrus with the beautiful flavor of
          lilikoi, yet still wonderfully sweet like a traditional pound cake.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>3 Cups Sugar</li>
          <li>
            1 1/2 Cups softened Butter + a few tablespoons to butter your pans
          </li>
          <li>3 Cups Flour</li>
          <li>6 Eggs, at room temperature</li>
          <li>6 oz . Passion Fruit Puree (Just the Juice)</li>
          <li>2 tsp Vanilla</li>
          <li>1 tsp Baking Powder</li>
          <li>1 tsp Salt</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit</li>
          <li>Prepare your pans by liberally greasing with butter.</li>
          <li>
            Cream together the sugar and butter, with a mixer, until well combined.
            Add 1 egg at a time until each one is incorporated into mixture.
          </li>
          <li>Add the passion fruit puree and vanilla until just combined.</li>
          <li>
            In a separate bowl sift together the flour, salt and baking powder. Add
            the flour mixture to the wet mixture in thirds until just incorporated.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pour your batter into the desired pan. I lift the pans about 2 inches
            above the cutting board and drop them to pop any bubbles and even out
            the top of the batter as best as I can.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bake until the sides start to turn brown and a toothpick comes out clean
            when put into the middle of the pound cake. The loaf pan took 55
            minutes. If the top is browning too quickly you can lower your heat. My
            convection oven cooks a little different than a traditional oven.
          </li>
          <li>Slice in 1/2 - 1 inch slices and serve.</li>
        </ol>

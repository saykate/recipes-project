    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      In the 90's, we had Orowheat Australian Toaster Biscuits and all was well.
      But then, the powers that be discontinued the beloved toaster biscuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike an English muffin, these are light and fluffy, tall and full of
      nooks and crannies just waiting for your choice of topping. Thanks to
      delishably, we can once again enjoy the long-missed breakfast delight.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3 cups plus 2/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>3/4 teaspoon cream of tartar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon active dry yeast</li>
      <li>2 1/4 cups warm water</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine the first 5 ingredients (flour through yeast) in a large mixing
        bowl. Slowly pour in warm water and stir to combine. I used my stand
        mixer and meat at low-medium speed for 8 minutes. If you do not have a
        mixer you can stir by hand. (You might want to enlist the aid of a
        helper.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Scrape batter (yes it will be a batter, not your typical bread dough)
        into a clean bowl, cover with plastic wrap and set in a warm place to
        proof (rise) for 1 hour or until doubled in size.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine baking soda and milk. Gently stir down batter; stir in the
        soda/milk mixture until well mixed.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
      <li>Line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
      <li>
        Heat griddle to medium heat. Spray griddle surface and rings with
        non-stick cooking spray. Place rings on the griddle, spaced several
        inches apart to allow room for flipping/turning.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fill rings half-full with batter. The amount will seem skimpy, but trust
        me, the batter will rise to the top of the ring. Allow to "bake"
        undisturbed for 8 minutes, then flip over to "bake" the other side. This
        will take just 3 minutes. (I had only two rings, so had to do this 6
        times.) Place toaster biscuits on the rimmed baking sheet, remove rings.
      </li>
      <li>
        When all biscuits are griddled, bake in preheated oven 5 minutes. Cool
        completely before slicing in half horizontally.
      </li>
      <li>To serve, toast biscuits and serve with butter or jam (or both).</li>
    </ol>
